Whilst measuring how the TEC was disrupted by sound waves after the Tohoku earthquake of 2011, he discovered - quite by accident - that the TEC was also disrupted in the 40 or so minutes before it.\r\n\r\nGoing back through GPS records he has found similar correlations for other major earthquakes, a discovery that is being heralded as a major breakthrough in our understanding of earthquake phenomena.\r\n\r\n### Paper\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ep.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/~heki/pdf/Heki_GRL2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Heki, K., Ionospheric electron enhancement preceding the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, Geophys.
